Please create a personalized meal plan based on the user's request below.
Follow these guidelines:

1. DIETARY REQUIREMENTS:
   - Strictly respect all mentioned dietary restrictions
   - If unsure about a restriction, choose the safest option
   - Never include prohibited ingredients

2. MEAL STRUCTURE:
   - 3-6 meals per day as requested
   - Balanced nutrition in each meal
   - Variety across days

3. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:
     {
       "days": [{
         "dayNumber": 1,
         "meals": [{
           "type": "Breakfast/Lunch/etc",
           "dishName": "string",
           "description": "string",
           "nutrition": {
             "calories": number,
             "protein": number,
             "carbs": number,
             "fat": number
           }
         }]
       }]
     }

4. FALLBACK STRATEGY:
   - If exact request can't be met, provide closest alternative
   - Never return error objects
   - For problematic requirements, add a 'note' field

5. EXAMPLE:
   User requests vegan but mentions paneer:
   - Note: "Paneer is dairy - substituted with tofu"
   - Still return complete meal plan
